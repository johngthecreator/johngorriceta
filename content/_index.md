Hi! My name is John Gorriceta and I'm an aspiring Software Developer studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho.  
\
I'm passionate about programming and fascinated with the digital infrastructure that society has created. It's undeniable that society has become incredibly reliant on various apps and programs. The unfortunate thing is that most individuals have no idea how any of these apps are made or know anything about the underlying infrastructure that make them work. My goal in life is to teach individuals how to program so that everyone can be a part of this digital revolution! I firmly believe that everyone can code and that the apps that they make have the potential to change the world.
