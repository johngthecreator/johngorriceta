### Project Based Learning
I believe that the best way to solidify programming concepts is by applying learned concepts to personal projects. These projects are a representation of some of the programming concepts I've learned over the course of my programming career.

### Projects:  
- Vimify: A lightweight Vim-based markdown editor written with Showdown.js, CodeMirror, and SASS.
